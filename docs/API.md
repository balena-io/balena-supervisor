# Interacting with the Resin Supervisor

The Resin Supervisor is resin.io's agent that runs on devices. Its main role is to ensure your app is running, and keep communications with the Resin API server.

The Supervisor itself has its own API, with means for user applications to communicate and execute some special actions that affect the host OS or the application itself. There are two main ways for the application to interact with the Supervisor: the update lockfile and the HTTP API.

Only Supervisors after version 1.1.0 have this functionality, and some of the endpoints appeared in later versions (we've noted it down where this is the case). Supervisor version 1.1.0 corresponds to OS images downloaded after October 14th 2015.

## HTTP API reference

The supervisor exposes an HTTP API on port 48484 (`RESIN_SUPERVISOR_PORT`).

**All endpoints require an apikey parameter, which is exposed to the application as `RESIN_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY`.**

The full address for the API, i.e. `"http://127.0.0.1:48484"`, is available as `RESIN_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS`. **Always use these variables when communicating via the API, since address and port could change**.

Alternatively, the Resin API (api.resin.io) has a proxy endpoint at `POST /supervisor/<url>` (where `<url>` is one of the API URLs described below) from which you can send API commands to the supervisor remotely, using your Auth Token instead of your API key. Commands sent through the proxy require an `appId` and/or `deviceId` parameter in the body, and default to POST requests unless you specify a `method` parameter (e.g. "GET").

The API is versioned (currently at v1), except for `/ping`.

You might notice that the formats of some responses differ. This is because they were implemented later, and in Go instead of node.js.

Here's the full list of endpoints implemented so far. In all examples, replace everything between `< >` for the corresponding values.

<hr>

### GET /ping

Responds with a simple "OK", signaling that the supervisor is alive and well.

#### Examples:
From the app on the device:
```bash
$ curl -X GET --header "Content-Type:application/json" \
	"$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS/ping?apikey=$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY"
```
Response:
```none
OK
```

Remotely via the API proxy:
```bash
$ curl -X POST --header "Content-Type:application/json" \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer <auth token>" \
	--data '{"deviceId": <deviceId>, "appId": <appId>, "method": "GET"}' \

```

<hr>

### POST /v1/blink

<hr>

### GET /v1/device

Introduced in supervisor v1.6.
Returns the current device state, as reported to the Resin API and with some extra fields added to allow control over pending/locked updates.
The state is a JSON object that contains some or all of the following:
* `api_port`: Port on which the supervisor is listening.
* `commit`: Hash of the current commit of the application that is running.
* `ip_address`: Space-separated list of IP addresses of the device.
* `status`: Status of the device regarding the app, as a string, i.e. "Stopping", "Starting", "Downloading", "Installing", "Idle".
* `download_progress`: Amount of the application image that has been downloaded, expressed as a percentage. If the update has already been downloaded, this will be `null`.
* `os_version`: Version of the host OS running on the device.
* `supervisor_version`: Version of the supervisor running on the device.
* `update_pending`: This one is not reported to the Resin API. It's a boolean that will be true if the supervisor has detected there is a pending update.
* `update_downloaded`: Not reported to the Resin API either. Boolean that will be true if a pending update has already been downloaded.
* `update_failed`: Not reported to the Resin API. Boolean that will be true if the supervisor has tried to apply a pending update but failed (i.e. if the app was locked, there was a network failure or anything else went wrong).

Other attributes may be added in the future, and some may be missing or null if they haven't been set yet.

#### Examples:
From the app on the device:
```bash
$ curl -X GET --header "Content-Type:application/json" \

## API endpoints for image and container management

Supervisor 1.9 introduces these endpoints to allow users to create images and containers from the app. These endpoints are designed to be
as close as possible to the corresponding endpoints from the Docker Remote API. We chose this approach instead of just exposing the docker socket
because we need the supervisor to track the containers and images to avoid cleaning them up unwantedly.

All examples are shown as posted from the app on the device, as this is the intended use, but the API proxy works like with the other endpoints.

Refer to the [Docker API docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.22) for detailed descriptions of request parameters and response formats.

### POST /v1/images/create

Works like [/images/create from the Docker API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.22/#create-an-image).
Allows the creation of images by pulling them from a registry or from a tar archive.

#### Example:

Creating an image from a tarball:
```bash
$ curl -X POST --data-binary @hello-master.tar \
	"$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS/v1/images/create?fromSrc=-&repo=hello&tag=master&apikey=$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY"
```

Pulling from DockerHub:
```bash
$ curl -X POST \
	"$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS/v1/images/create?fromImage=alpine&tag=latest&apikey=$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY"
```

<hr>

### POST /v1/images/load

Works like [/images/load from the Docker API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.22/#load-a-tarball-with-a-set-of-images-and-tags-into-docker).
Allows the creation of images from a tar archived produced by `docker save`.

#### Example:

```bash
$ curl -X POST --data-binary @images.tar \
	"$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS/v1/images/load?apikey=$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY"
```

<hr>

### DELETE /v1/images/:name

Deletes image with name `name`. Works like [DELETE /images/(name) from the Docker API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.22/#remove-an-image).
Will only work if `name` is sent as the `repo:tag` used for creating the image.

#### Example:

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE \
	"$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS/v1/images/hello:master?apikey=$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY"
```

<hr>

### GET /v1/images

Works like [GET /images/json from the Docker API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.22/#list-images).

#### Example:

```bash
$ curl -X GET \

```

<hr>

### POST /v1/containers/create

Works like [/containers/create from the Docker API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.22/#create-a-container).
Can only be used with `Image` specifying a `repo:tag` created with /v1/images/create.

#### Example:

```
$ curl -X POST --data '{"Image":"alpine:latest","Cmd":["sh","-c", "while true; do echo hi; sleep 5; done"]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	"$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS/v1/containers/create?apikey=$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY"
```

<hr>

### POST /v1/containers/:id/start

Starts a container. Works like [/containers/(id)/start from the Docker API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.22/#start-a-container).
The id can be extracted from the response of /v1/containers/create.

#### Example:

```
$ curl -X POST \
	"$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS/v1/containers/ac072860f31a9df31dea72f8418d193e6af257b4fed4008f86097200fba45966/start?apikey=$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY"
```

<hr>

### POST /v1/containers/:id/stop

Stops a container. Works like [/containers/(id)/stop from the Docker API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.22/#stop-a-container).

The id can be extracted from the response of /v1/containers/create.

#### Example:

```
$ curl -X DELETE \
	"$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS/v1/containers/ac072860f31a9df31dea72f8418d193e6af257b4fed4008f86097200fba45966?apikey=$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY"
```

### GET /v1/containers
